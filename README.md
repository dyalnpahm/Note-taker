# Note Taker

## Description

The motivation behind this project is to build a note taking application to organise information into an understandable format to study and learn.
I built this project to understand expressjs, and to help create a functional note taking application which can be deployed to HTTPS
I learnt expressjs, nodemon, fs and more.

## Installation

Open the link, click the get started button, then enter the note's title and note into the textbox on the right, finally click save to save the note.
